# addThumbnailToVideo
This tool uses FFmpeg to prepend a short freeze-frame intro to a video. Creates a short clip (e.g., 3 frames long) from that single image. The tool then merges this  thumbnailclip with the original video while preserving the original audio, ensuring smooth playback and synchronization.
